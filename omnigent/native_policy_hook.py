"""Shared conversion between native-harness hooks and Omnigent policy events.

Both Claude Code and Codex expose a command-hook system whose
``PreToolUse`` / ``PostToolUse`` payloads use the same field names
(``hook_event_name``, ``tool_name``, ``tool_input``, ``tool_output``)
and whose ``UserPromptSubmit`` payload carries the user prompt under
``prompt``. This module owns the harness-neutral translation between
that hook shape and the server's proto-compatible ``EvaluationRequest``
/ ``EvaluationResponse`` schema served by
``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/policies/evaluate``, so the per-harness hook
entrypoints (:mod:`omnigent.claude_native_hook`,
:mod:`omnigent.codex_native_hook`) share one implementation.

The output contract differs by hook event: ``PreToolUse`` enforces via
``hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision``, while ``UserPromptSubmit``
enforces via the top-level ``decision`` / ``reason`` fields (both
harnesses parse ``decision: "block"`` to drop the prompt before the
model sees it).

    Convert an ``EvaluationResponse`` into native-harness hook output JSON.

    For ``PreToolUse`` the policy layer only *enforces* — it emits a
    ``hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`` solely for verdicts that
    constrain the tool: ``POLICY_ACTION_DENY`` → ``"deny"`` (with
    ``permissionDecisionReason``). ``POLICY_ACTION_ASK`` is resolved
    server-side now (URL-based elicitation: ``POST /policies/evaluate``
    holds the gate and returns a hard ALLOW/DENY), so the hook should
    never see ASK; if it does, it fails closed with ``"deny"`` rather
    than the old ``"defer"`` — ``defer`` handed control back to the
    harness's ``permission_mode``, which ``acceptEdits`` /
    ``bypassPermissions`` would auto-approve, bypassing the human.
    ``POLICY_ACTION_ALLOW`` — which is the engine's default verdict when
    no policy matches a tool call, not just an explicit author allow —
    returns ``None`` ("no opinion") so the harness's *own* permission
    system still runs. Emitting ``"allow"`` here would auto-approve the
    tool and suppress the harness's native permission prompt (and, for
    Claude Code, the ``PermissionRequest`` hook that routes that prompt
    to the web UI), collapsing two independent gates — the deployment's
    policy gate and the user's own consent gate — into one. The policy
    layer may block (DENY) or demand approval (ASK); it must not silence
    the user's consent. For ``PostToolUse`` a ``DENY`` is surfaced as
    ``additionalContext`` because the tool result is already committed
    — PostToolUse hooks cannot block.

    For ``UserPromptSubmit`` the output uses the top-level ``decision`` /
    ``reason`` contract (not ``permissionDecision``): ``DENY`` → ``{"decision":
    "block", "reason": ...}``, which drops the prompt before the model sees
    it. ASK is resolved server-side (``_hold_native_ask_gate`` collapses it
    to a hard ALLOW/DENY before the response reaches the hook), so the hook
    should never see ASK; if it somehow does, it fails closed by blocking.
    ALLOW (and the engine's no-match default) returns ``None`` so the prompt
    proceeds. Unlike ``PreToolUse``, there is no separate user-consent gate
    on a prompt, so ALLOW need not preserve one.

    Both Claude Code and Codex consume these exact output shapes, so the

    returns an empty / malformed body. Without this the hooks emitted "no

    Bash / Write / Edit / the native Skill tool / connector-native

    or ``None`` if the budget is exhausted or a non-retryable error occurs.

    A stable ``_omnigent_elicitation_id`` is minted once and stamped on
    every attempt. When the server parks an ASK gate and the connection
    drops (5xx or :class:`httpx.ConnectError`), the retry re-POSTs the

    idiom used by the ``PermissionRequest`` hook. This prevents a
    second approval card from appearing when the first was already
    published before the error.

    4xx responses are final — a bad request won't succeed on retry. Other
    mid-stream errors (e.g. :class:`httpx.ReadTimeout`) are also not retried:
    a read timeout fires *after* the server received the request and may
    mean the long-polling ASK gate was severed mid-wait; retrying with the

        headers triggers an immediate retry with them, mirroring the runner's
        refresh-capable :class:`~omnigent.runner._entry._RunnerDatabricksAuth`.
        ``None`` (the default) keeps the legacy behavior for callers that have
