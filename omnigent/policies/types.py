"""
Runtime evaluation contracts for the policy system.

These are the shapes that cross the ``Policy.evaluate()``
boundary and the engine-to-approval-helper boundary. They are
NOT spec types — they do not appear in any config.yaml the user
writes. Spec types (what the parser consumes and emits) live in
:mod:`omnigent.spec.types`; runtime evaluation types live
here.

Three types live in this module:

- :class:`EvaluationContext` — what the caller hands to the
  engine on each enforcement call (phase + content +
  resolved tool_name).
- :class:`PolicyResult` — what a single policy returns and what
  the engine composes across policies.
- :class:`ElicitationRequest` — the internal contract for an
  ASK that's about to be surfaced upstream as an MCP-style
  elicitation. Carries the human-readable message plus the
  policy-context fields the renderer needs (phase,
  policy_name, content_preview).

Agent-author Python callables import :class:`EvaluationContext`
and :class:`PolicyResult` from here (or from the
:mod:`omnigent.policies` package entry point).

class EvaluationContext:
    """
    Everything the engine needs to evaluate one phase.

    Filled by the caller (workflow or executor hook) BEFORE
    calling ``engine.evaluate(ctx)``. The engine never has to
    introspect ``content`` to answer "which tool was this?" —
    the caller resolves ``tool_name`` because only it has the
    local state to do so cheaply (on ``TOOL_RESULT`` the
    ``function_call_output`` payload carries ``call_id`` but no
    ``name``; the caller knows the name from the earlier
    dispatch).

    :param phase: The enforcement point.
    :param content: Phase-specific payload — shape depends on
        ``phase``:

        - ``REQUEST`` / ``RESPONSE``: ``str`` (raw user /
          assistant text).
        - ``TOOL_CALL``: ``dict[str, Any]`` shaped
          ``{"name": <name>, "arguments": <parsed-args-dict>}``.
        - ``TOOL_RESULT``: ``dict`` shaped ``{"result": <tool-output>}``.
        - ``LLM_REQUEST``: ``dict`` with the full LLM prompt
          (system instructions, messages, tool schemas).
        - ``LLM_RESPONSE``: ``dict`` with the raw model output
          before tool-call extraction or post-processing.

        Policies know which shape to expect from their declared
        ``on:`` phases — the engine never introspects this field
        itself.
    :param tool_name: Resolved tool name. Populated on
        ``TOOL_CALL`` and ``TOOL_RESULT``; ``None`` on
        ``REQUEST``, ``RESPONSE``, ``LLM_REQUEST``, and
        ``LLM_RESPONSE``.
    :param trajectory: Recent conversation items (oldest first)
        the classifier may consume to produce situational
        reason text — see designs/LIVE_POLICIES.md §4.1. The
        engine populates this on every ``evaluate()`` call by
        querying the conversation store; callers leave it
        ``None``. ``FunctionPolicy`` ignores the field;
        ``PromptPolicy`` formats it into the
        classifier prompt. ``None`` means "engine never
        populated it" (test contexts); empty list means
        "brand-new conversation, no items yet."
    :param actor: Identity of the principal executing the
        request. Shape:
        ``{"run_as": "<email>", "client_id": "<oauth-client>"}``.
        ``None`` when identity is unknown (tests, legacy
        callers). Passed through to the ``event.context.actor``
        field that :class:`FunctionPolicy` builds for its
        callable.
    :param request_data: Original tool-call payload on
        ``TOOL_RESULT`` phase, so ON RESULT policies can
        correlate input/output. ``None`` on all other phases.
        Surfaced as ``event["request_data"]`` to the callable.
    :param session_state: Mutable per-conversation key/value
        store scoped to the engine's lifetime (one workflow
        turn). Does NOT persist across turns. Injected by the
        engine before each policy dispatch so callables can
        read accumulated state (e.g. a running counter, a
        previously-extracted entity). The engine owns
        population of this field — callers leave it ``None``.
        Surfaced as ``event["session_state"]`` to the callable.
        ``None`` means "engine not yet populated" (test
        contexts); empty dict means "no state written yet."
    :param usage: Cumulative LLM token usage for this session.
        Shape: ``{"input_tokens": N, "output_tokens": M,
        "total_tokens": T}``. Injected by the engine before
        each policy dispatch so callables can read the running
        totals (e.g. for budget-enforcement policies).
        Surfaced as ``event["context"]["usage"]`` to the
        callable. ``None`` means "engine not yet populated"
        (test contexts); empty dict means "no usage recorded
        yet."
    :param user_daily_cost: The session owner's per-UTC-day cost
        rollup, shape
        ``{"cost_usd": <float>, "ask_approved_usd": <float>}``,
        read from the ``user_daily_cost`` store at engine-build time.
        Injected ONLY when a policy needs it (the per-user daily
        cost-budget policy is configured) — ``None`` otherwise, so
        sessions without that policy pay no owner/daily-cost lookup.
        Surfaced as ``event["context"]["user_daily_cost"]``.
    :param model: The model the session is currently using —
        the conversation's ``model_override`` when set (e.g. via
        a mid-session ``/model`` change), else the agent spec's
        ``llm.model``, e.g. ``"databricks-claude-opus-4-8"`` or
        the native tier alias ``"opus"``. Injected by the engine
        before each policy dispatch (resolved at engine-build
        time) so callables can gate on the active model (e.g. a
        cost policy that forces a downgrade off an expensive
        model). Surfaced as ``event["context"]["model"]`` to the
        callable. ``None`` when the engine could not determine a
        model (no override and no spec ``llm``).
    :param harness: The harness running the session, e.g.
        ``"codex-native"``, stamped by a native tool hook so policies can
        tailor messages to how that harness lets the user switch model
        (codex-native is terminal-only). Surfaced as
        ``event["context"]["harness"]``. ``None`` on web / API / unstamped
        paths.
    :param labels: Read-only snapshot of the conversation's guardrails
        labels, e.g. ``{"cost_control.plan": "{...}"}``. Injected by the
        engine from its label hot cache (the same source ``condition:``
        gates read) so function policy callables can gate on persisted
        label state via ``event["context"]["labels"]``. ``None`` means
        "not populated" (runner-local gate, test contexts) — policies
        must treat that the same as an empty mapping.
    :param llm_client: An :class:`~omnigent.policies.types.PolicyLLMClient`
        instance configured with the server-level LLM credentials.
        Available to function policy callables via
        ``event["llm_client"]``. ``None`` when the server has no
        ``llm:`` config. The client is shared across all policies
        in one engine; each call should pass ``model`` and
        ``connection_params`` from the engine's resolved config.

    decision, the engine composes them and returns the
    aggregate.

    :param reason: Human-readable reason string. Shown to the

        phase). ``None`` means "use original content unchanged".

        operations to apply to the engine's ``session_state``.

        value. Accumulated across all policies in the evaluation
        pass and applied by the engine on ALLOW and DENY;

    Mirrors the wire-shape of an MCP ``elicitation/create`` form-mode

    to the binary approve / reject use case ASK policies need today.
    The verdict is carried in the consumer's MCP-style
