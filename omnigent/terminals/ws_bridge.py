"""Shared PTY ↔ WebSocket bridge for tmux ``attach`` sessions.

Lives under :mod:`omnigent.terminals` (alongside the
:class:`TerminalRegistry`) because both the server and the runner
need the bridge and neither one "owns" it. Importing from a neutral
location avoids a runner → ``server.routes`` dependency.

Used by:

- :mod:`omnigent.server.routes.terminal_attach`, when no runner WS
  factory is configured (in-process / test setups, where the tmux
  socket lives on the same filesystem the server can see).
- :mod:`omnigent.runner.app`, where the runner exposes its own WS
  attach endpoint so out-of-process runners run ``tmux attach``
  locally and never expose a socket path to the server.

Wire protocol (same as the original server route):

- **Server → client**: every PTY read becomes a *binary* WS frame.
- **Client → server**:
    - **Text frames** are JSON control messages. Currently only
      ``{"type": "resize", "cols": N, "rows": M}`` (applied via
      ``ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ)``); unknown shapes are ignored for
      forward-compat.
    - **Binary frames** are raw input bytes written to the PTY.
      Dropped silently when ``read_only`` is true.
