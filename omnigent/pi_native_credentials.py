"""Translate the omnigent-configured model provider into native Pi config.

A native Pi session launches the ``pi`` CLI, which authenticates from its own
config directory (``~/.pi/agent``). Without help, a user who ran ``omnigent
setup`` would still have to run ``pi`` ``/login`` separately — unlike
claude-native / codex-native, which route through the provider that ``omnigent
setup`` configured.

This module closes that gap. It resolves the provider configured for the Pi
surface (``~/.omnigent/config.yaml``) and writes a per-session ``models.json``
into a *managed* Pi config dir (selected via ``PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR``), so the
runner-owned ``pi`` process authenticates exactly like the configured harness —
mirroring how codex-native routes through the Databricks AI Gateway.

The managed config dir is per-session (like codex-native's managed
``CODEX_HOME``), so this never mutates the user's global ``~/.pi/agent``.
