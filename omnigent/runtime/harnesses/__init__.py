"""
Harness package — per-conversation subprocesses that implement a
subset of the Omnigent REST API.

See ``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md`` for the full contract.
The harness IS an HTTP service speaking the same Pydantic models AP
serves to external clients (re-use ``omnigent.server.schemas`` —
there is no separate protocol module).

This package contains:

- ``_HARNESS_MODULES``: registry mapping harness name (the value of
  ``spec.executor.harness`` in an agent spec) to the fully-qualified
  Python module path that exports a zero-argument ``create_app() ->
  FastAPI``. Populated as per-harness wraps land (Phase 1 step 4).
- ``process_manager``: ``HarnessProcessManager`` — owns
  per-conversation subprocess lifecycle.
- ``_runner``: shared ``python -m`` entrypoint that any registered
  harness's ``create_app()`` is served through.

The package directory is intentionally small. Behavior lives in the
sibling modules; this ``__init__.py`` is just the registry.
