# ── Omnigent MCP relay wiring (sys_* tools) ──────────────────────────────────
#
# agy is otherwise tool-isolated from Omnigent: unlike claude/codex/cursor it
# wires no MCP relay, so the wrapped agy cannot reach any ``sys_*`` tool (spawn
# sub-agent sessions, drive Omnigent terminals, list agents/models, ``sys_os_*``).
# This section wires the SAME relay cursor #742 uses — the shared
# ``omnigent.claude_native_bridge serve-mcp`` stdio server — into agy.
#
# THE CONFIG-SCOPING FOOTGUN. agy has no ``--mcp-config`` flag and ignores every
# ``ANTIGRAVITY_*`` env knob; it loads MCP servers from a single HOME-GLOBAL file,
# ``$HOME/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`` — the *same* file the user's
# interactive agy reads (verified empirically against agy 1.0.12). Writing that
# file directly would (a) clobber/pollute the user's interactive agy config and
# (b) be incorrect under concurrency: the relay command is bridge-dir-specific, so
# two antigravity-native sessions (or a session + the user's interactive agy)
# would fight over the one global file.
#
# CHOSEN DESIGN — per-session ISOLATED HOME. The runner launches agy with
# ``HOME`` pointed at a per-bridge-dir tree (:func:`agy_home_dir`) seeded with a
# COPY of the user's OAuth token + onboarding/migration markers and a
# bridge-scoped ``config/mcp_config.json`` written by :func:`write_mcp_config`.
# This (1) NEVER touches the user's real ``~/.gemini``, (2) gives each session its
# own ``mcp_config.json`` so concurrent sessions never clobber one another, and
# (3) was verified live: agy under the isolated HOME does NOT re-demand OAuth and
# its ``/mcp`` panel shows ``✓ omnigent`` with the ``sys_*`` tools discovered. agy
# resolves ``GeminiDir`` from ``$HOME/.gemini`` (its hardcoded default), so the
# only thing the isolated HOME relocates is the *config + state* tree; auth still
# works because the seeded token is a copy of the user's real one.

    Deliver a user message into the agy TUI via a tmux bracketed paste + Enter.

    The executor's delivery path for EVERY web/mobile turn (sequential and
    mid-turn steer): a turn delivered over agy's connect-RPC ``SendAgentMessage``
    is recorded as a ``SYSTEM_MESSAGE`` the forwarder would not mirror, whereas
    typing into the TUI creates a real ``USER_INPUT`` step the forwarder mirrors
    in order. On a fresh session this also creates agy's conversation (agy mints
    its id only after processing a turn), which the forwarder then discovers.

    Steps: wait for the advertised tmux target and the agy input box (idle OR a
    running turn — agy accepts a mid-turn paste), clear any leftover draft (Home +
    kill-to-end), stream the content through a named tmux buffer
    (``load-buffer``/``paste-buffer -p`` so interior newlines stay data and a
    large message is not capped by the send-keys argv limit), wait for the draft
    to render, then submit (footer-verified when idle; best-effort mid-turn — see
    :func:`_submit_and_verify`).

    :param bridge_dir: Native Antigravity bridge directory holding ``tmux.json``.
    :param content: User text from the web UI. Must be non-empty.
    :param timeout_s: Total readiness budget, shared across the two gates
        (``tmux.json`` advertised, then the input box mounted) so the worst case
        is one ``timeout_s``, not two stacked.
    :returns: None.
    :raises RuntimeError: When the tmux target is never advertised, the agy TUI
        has exited, a tmux command fails, or the submit never starts a turn.

    Send raw key arguments to the agy TUI pane to answer its in-process prompt.

    The companion to :func:`inject_user_message_via_tui` for the OTHER thing the
    attended agy TUI maintains in parallel with the RPC step state: its
    **in-process permission / question prompt**. When agy runs attended (the
    web/mobile path types every turn into the TUI), an approval surfaces in the
    Omnigent web UI AND as agy's own numbered TUI prompt ("Do you want to
    proceed?", 1.Yes … 4.No). Delivering the verdict over
    :func:`omnigent.antigravity_native_rpc.handle_user_interaction` flips the
    backend trajectory step to DONE and the command runs, but the **TUI prompt
    for that interaction can stay open** — and the next typed turn then lands in
    that stale prompt's filter/amend buffer instead of starting a fresh turn
    (live-verified; see ``docs/claude/antigravity-rpc-spike-notes.md`` §"attended
    TUI"). So the bridge ALSO types the selection into the pane to dismiss the
    prompt, mirroring cursor-native's
    :func:`omnigent.cursor_native_bridge.send_cursor_pane_keys`.

    Each argument is a tmux ``send-keys`` key argument — a bare ``"1"`` / ``"4"``
    selects a numbered option, ``"Enter"`` confirms, ``"Escape"`` cancels — sent
    in order as ONE ``send-keys`` invocation so the digit and its Enter cannot be
    reordered or split across the pane's input handling. Keys are interpreted by
    tmux (no ``-l``), so named keys like ``Enter`` / ``Escape`` work.

    :param bridge_dir: Native Antigravity bridge directory holding ``tmux.json``.
    :param keys: Ordered tmux key arguments, e.g. ``("1", "Enter")`` to approve.
