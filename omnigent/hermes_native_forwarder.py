"""TUI→web forwarder for the hermes-native harness.

The ``omnigent hermes`` wrapper launches the real ``hermes`` TUI in a runner-owned
tmux pane, and :mod:`omnigent.hermes_native_bridge` injects web-UI messages into
it. That covers the web→TUI direction, but the *embedded terminal* is then the
only surface that reflects the agent's work — the Omnigent conversation view (chat
bubbles, title) stays empty because nothing mirrors the TUI's transcript back into
the session.

This module is that missing mirror — the Hermes analog of
:mod:`omnigent.goose_native_forwarder`. Hermes stores all sessions in a single
SQLite database at ``$HERMES_HOME/state.db`` (default ``~/.hermes/state.db``,
verified against the hermes-agent ``hermes_state.py`` schema): a ``sessions`` row
per session (``id`` TEXT, ``source``, ``cwd``, ``started_at`` REAL-seconds) and a
``messages`` row per turn (``id`` autoincrement, ``session_id`` FK, ``role``,
``content`` TEXT, ``active``).

Unlike goose-native, Hermes auto-generates its ``sessions.id`` and gives no
``--name`` to pin it, so discovery follows cursor-native instead: bind the newest
session whose ``cwd`` matches this terminal's workspace and whose ``started_at`` is
at/after the recorded launch time, with a claim guard so two hermes-native sessions
launched in the same cwd never mirror the same row into two conversations. We then
poll ``messages`` past a high-water ``id`` and POST new user/assistant rows as
``external_conversation_item`` events (which also seeds the session title).

Status (``running``/``idle``) is intentionally NOT posted here: the runner's
PTY-activity watcher owns those edges for hermes-native (see
:mod:`omnigent.runner.app`), exactly as for goose-/cursor-native.
