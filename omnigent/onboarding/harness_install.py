"""Harness CLI install + auth operations — shared by ``run`` and ``configure``.

A coding harness is "ready" along two independent axes:

- **configured** — a usable model credential serves its family (resolved via
  :func:`omnigent.onboarding.provider_config.default_provider_for_harness`
  over the ambient-merged config). That lives in the provider layer.
- **installed** — the harness's CLI binary is on ``PATH``. This module owns
  that axis, mirroring how ``ucode`` checks (``shutil.which(binary)``) and the
  npm packages it installs.

``omnigent setup --no-internal-beta`` uses this to mark an uninstalled harness and
offer to ``npm install`` it; the first-run ``omnigent run`` flow uses the
same map so the two surfaces never disagree about what the machine can launch.

This module also owns the per-harness **CLI binary name**, so it is the natural
home for driving each harness's own *subscription login/logout* commands
(:func:`harness_login` / :func:`harness_logout`) — letting ``configure
harnesses`` be the single place a user signs in or out of Claude / Codex rather
than running ``codex login`` / ``claude auth login`` by hand.

The "is the CLI logged in?" verdict (:func:`harness_cli_logged_in`) asks the
CLI itself (``claude auth status`` / ``codex login status`` / ``agy models``)
rather than reading a credential file, because the file location is
**platform-specific**
— Claude Code stores its OAuth tokens in the macOS Keychain (not
``~/.claude/.credentials.json``) on macOS, so a file check would falsely report
"not logged in" right after a successful ``claude auth login``. The CLI's own
status command reads wherever it actually stored the credential, so login
verification is correct on every platform. (Ambient detection in
:mod:`omnigent.onboarding.ambient` is file-based and subprocess-free on
Linux; on macOS it reuses :func:`harness_cli_logged_in` as a Keychain fallback
when the credentials file is absent — see ``ambient._claude_login_detected``.)
