"""Browser e2e for the Clone session flow (ForkSessionDialog).

Drives the real chain the unit layer can't: per-message "Fork from
here" action → Radix dialog → ``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/fork`` → close +
navigate into the clone → the copied transcript renders from the fork's
snapshot. (The desktop header has no Clone button — the per-message
action is the desktop entry point; mobile keeps a three-dot menu entry.)

The seeded session is runner-bound with no workspace, so the dialog takes
the non-coding path (plain "Clone", no host/directory picker, no runner
launch). The host-bound "Clone & start" variant fires its runner launch
in the background and needs a connected ``omnigent host`` daemon this
harness doesn't spawn; its pieces are covered by the dialog unit tests
(background launch + error handoff to ``useForkLaunchStore``) and the
``ResumeWithDirectoryDialog`` ``initialError`` test.
