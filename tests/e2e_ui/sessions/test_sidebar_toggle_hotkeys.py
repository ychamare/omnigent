"""E2E: ⌘⌥[ / ⌘⌥] toggle the left and right sidebars from the app shell.

Covers ``useSidebarToggleHotkeys`` (``ap-web/src/hooks/useSidebarToggleHotkeys.ts``),
wired in ``AppShell``: a window-level keydown listener flips the left
(Conversations) sidebar on ⌘/Ctrl + ⌥/Alt + ``[`` and the right (Workspace)
rail on ⌘/Ctrl + ⌥/Alt + ``]``. The hook matches the physical ``e.code``
(``BracketLeft`` / ``BracketRight``) rather than the character, because ⌥ on
macOS turns ``[``/``]`` into ``“``/``‘`` — only a code match survives the
modifier. CI runs Linux chromium, so this presses the ``Control+Alt`` chord
(the hook also accepts Cmd via ``metaKey`` on macOS).

Two design points this exercises end-to-end that the unit test cannot:

- the listener is bound at the window, so the chord fires *even while the
  composer is focused* (a sibling of the ⌘↑/↓ session-switch and ⌘↵ approve
  hotkeys). We focus the composer with an unsent draft, then collapse the
  Conversations sidebar with the chord, and assert the draft is untouched —
  proving the chord toggled the panel without stealing the keystroke or
  navigating away.
- the right-rail toggle runs the shared ``toggleRightPanel`` (open-state +
  per-session persistence + URL sync), the same path the header's collapse
  button uses, so the two can't drift.

No LLM turn is needed — this is pure client-side keyboard + layout state — so
it skips the nightly/real-agent markers the approval suites carry. The seeded
session renders both rails on the desktop viewport these tests run at: the
sidebar defaults open (``min-width: 768px``), the Workspace rail defaults open
and always has content (the Agents tab is unconditional).
