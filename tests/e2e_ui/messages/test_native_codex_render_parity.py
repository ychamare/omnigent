r"""UI journey: a native Codex session renders parity with its TUI.

The native ``codex-native`` ("Codex") wrapper is terminal-first: a real
``codex`` CLI runs in the session terminal, the SPA's **Terminal** view
attaches to that live TUI over a WebSocket, and the SPA's **Chat** view renders
the SAME canonical transcript (``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/items``) the TUI prints.
A native bridge forwards web-composer messages INTO the Codex app-server thread
and forwards Codex's transcript back OUT as conversation items. This suite
asserts that round-trips both ways and renders exactly once — the three
properties the native forwarder has historically regressed on:

1. **Render parity with the TUI.** Composer turns are sent through the web SPA;
   each per-turn user marker and assistant token the SPA shows in a bubble must
   also appear in the canonical transcript, in the same order, exactly once. The
   transcript is what the TUI prints, so transcript parity == "renders the same
   as the TUI".

2. **A TUI-originated message surfaces in the web UI.** A turn is typed directly
   into the Codex TUI (the embedded xterm in the Terminal view) — never through
   the composer. The native bridge must forward it back out as a user item +
   assistant reply, so switching to Chat shows both as bubbles and the
   transcript carries them. This is the OUT direction the composer turns don't
   exercise.

3. **No duplicate rendering.** Every marker/token — composer- and TUI-originated
   alike — must land in EXACTLY ONE bubble and one transcript entry. The classic
   native-forwarder bug double-rendered a reply as both a streaming live preview
   and the committed bubble; per-turn unique tokens make that count unambiguous.

Per-turn unique markers/tokens are load-bearing for the same reasons as the
custom-agent suite: they keep the dedup count and order checks unambiguous even
though Codex is far chattier than the ``echo_probe`` agent (it may emit
reasoning, tool calls, and prose around the echoed token). Every assertion
counts *bubbles/entries containing the token*, never bubbles, so chattiness is
fine.

Requires the native-harness gateway auth the runner derives from its own
credentials (the same gateway ``hello_world`` uses); CI exchanges Databricks
OAuth before pytest. See ``native_codex_session`` in ``conftest.py``.
