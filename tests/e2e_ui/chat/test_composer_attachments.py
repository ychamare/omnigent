"""E2E: attaching and removing files in the chat composer.

The composer (``pages/ChatPage.tsx``) lets the user attach files via the
paperclip button (which clicks a hidden ``<input type="file">``), paste, or
drag-drop. Each attached file renders as a chip below the textarea with a
per-file remove button; on send the files are embedded inline in the message
(there is no separate upload endpoint), and ``removeFile`` drops a chip.

This flow has no coverage below the browser: no ap-web vitest test exercises
the ChatPage composer's ``addFiles`` / ``removeFile`` path, and the attach
mechanism (a real hidden file input populated by the OS file picker) is exactly
what a unit test can't drive. Playwright's ``set_input_files`` populates the
hidden input directly — the same change event the picker fires — so the
attach → chip → remove cycle is fully deterministic and needs no agent turn or
network: the chips are local component state.

The assertion pins to the chip's per-file remove control
(``aria-label="Remove {filename}"``, ChatPage.tsx) appearing after attach and
disappearing after the remove click.
