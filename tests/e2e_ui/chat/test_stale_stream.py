"""Stale-stream banner: kill the runner mid-stream, verify the UI reacts.

The frontend polls ``GET /health?session_id=`` every 10 s while a
response is streaming. When the runner crashes, the tunnel drops and
the health endpoint returns ``runner_online: false``. The next poll
flips ``streamStale`` in the chat store, which swaps the "Working…"
shimmer for an "Agent is unresponsive" banner.

This test exercises the full chain: SPA → SSE stream → health poll →
banner render. It kills the runner subprocess with SIGKILL while the
mock LLM is blocking (``block: true``), so the tunnel drops instantly
— no graceful shutdown, no terminal SSE event.
