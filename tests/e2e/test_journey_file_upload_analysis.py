    Upload markdown files and verify the agent analyzes their content.

    Steps:

    1. Create a runner-bound session with the archer agent.
    2. Upload a markdown file containing a distinctive fact
       ("The capital of Freedonia is Quuxville.").
    3. Ask the agent what the capital of Freedonia is according to the
       document; assert "Quuxville" appears in the response.
    4. Upload a second markdown file with a different fact
       ("The population of Freedonia is 42,000.").
    5. Ask the agent to use both documents to report the capital and
       population; assert both "Quuxville" and "42,000" appear.
