"""
End-to-end proof that policies declared in an omnigent YAML
are enforced by the omnigent workflow under Omnigent mode.

The adapter in :mod:`omnigent.spec.omnigent` lifts the
YAML's ``policies:`` block into
:attr:`AgentSpec.guardrails.policies`; the omnigent runtime
builds a :class:`PolicyEngine` over those specs and enforces at
the four hook points (``input``, ``tool_call``, ``tool_result``,
``output``). This test drives the whole path with a real LLM
call and asserts the policy actually fires.

**Why this test exists separately from the per-YAML example
sweep**: the stock ``examples/*.yaml`` policy fixtures rely on
the legacy omnigent ``(content, phase)`` callable signature
(``examples.tool_functions.block_long_sleep`` et al.), which
Omnigent' :class:`FunctionPolicy` dispatcher can't invoke
(it passes ``(ctx, context)`` where ``ctx`` is an
:class:`EvaluationContext` dataclass, not a dict). This test
uses the omnigent-shaped
``omnigent._e2e_policy_callables.block_on_sentinel``
callable — an arity-1 callable matching Omnigent'
convention — so the test proves the translator + engine
integration works and isn't muddied by a separate callable-
portability gap. That gap is tracked in ``TODO_omnigent_coverage.md``.

**What breaks if this test fails:**

- The adapter stops lifting policies into
  ``guardrails.policies`` → the engine sees zero policies and
  the sentinel-blocked prompt gets an assistant reply.
- The runtime stops reading ``guardrails`` from specs
  synthesized via the omnigent adapter.
- The DENY sentinel format changes (``[Denied by policy: ...]``
  → something else) without the hook point being updated.

    1. The translator expanded ``on: [tool_call] + match_tools:

    ``match_tools: [<agent_tool_name>]`` fires when the LLM
    invokes the sub-agent under its declared name — closes
    Gap 8 (TODO_omnigent_coverage.md).

    Before the fix, inline :class:`AgentTool` calls routed
    through Omnigent' generic ``sys_session_send`` builtin,
    so TOOL_CALL enforcement saw ``tool_name ==
    "sys_session_send"`` regardless of which sub-agent the LLM
    picked. ``match_tools: [worker]`` never matched because the
    name the policy filters on and the name the engine sees
    disagreed. The fix dispatches the sub-agent call under the
    declared YAML name so the two agree.

    What breaks if this fails:

    - The bridge stops dispatching :class:`AgentTool` calls
      directly and falls back to ``sys_session_send`` — policy
      filter rows out again.
    - The TOOL_CALL enforcement hook stops firing before the
      spawn is routed, so the sub-agent starts despite the
      DENY verdict.
    - The sub-agent's output leaks through the denied call
      (the bridge's DENY-sentinel short-circuit regressed).
