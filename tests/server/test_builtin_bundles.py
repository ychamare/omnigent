"""Tests for the built-in agent bundle builders in ``omnigent/server/app.py``.

The server seeds Web-UI-launchable agents (claude-native, codex-native, and
the shipped ``debby`` / ``polly`` examples) by materializing each spec into a
gzipped tarball at startup. These builders were previously exercised only
transitively by the agents' e2e suites; a packaging regression (a dropped
``config.yaml``, a spec that no longer materializes) would surface late and
slow. These unit tests build each bundle directly and assert it is a valid,
reproducible tarball containing the expected spec entry.
