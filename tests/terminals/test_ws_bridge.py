Unit tests for :mod:`omnigent.terminals.ws_bridge`.

Covers ``_write_all_nonblocking`` (retry-on-backpressure / short-write
semantics over a real ``os.pipe``), the tmux-attach child reaper, the
detach-vs-terminal-gone close-code logic that distinguishes a tmux
detach (session still alive) from a real session exit,
and ``_forward_pty_to_ws`` PTY→WS frame coalescing (queued bursts merge
into one frame; a lone keystroke still flushes immediately).
