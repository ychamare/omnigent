"""Tests for :mod:`omnigent.runtime.filesystem_registry`.

Covers the ``list_changed_files`` merge logic for :class:`AgentEditFilesystemRegistry`
— specifically the invariant that a file first created in a session keeps status
``"created"`` even when subsequently edited within the same session.

Also covers ``seed_snapshot``, ``get_baseline`` for both implementations, and
``_normalize_path``.

Events are injected via :func:`_inject`, which calls :meth:`record_change` on
the registry so tests exercise the same code path as real tool calls.
