"""
Tests for :class:`omnigent.runtime.harnesses.process_manager.HarnessProcessManager`.

Covers the lifecycle / behavior surface defined by §Process
management of ``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md``: lazy spawn,
caching, crash detection, release, idle reaping, orphan sweep.

The tests use the real fixture harness module
``tests.runtime.harnesses._test_harness`` (a minimal FastAPI app
with ``/health`` + introspection endpoints) wired through a real
runner subprocess. End-to-end with real uvicorn rather than a mock
because the spawn handshake (waiting for the socket to appear) is
what's most likely to break.

Tests intentionally use a short tmp parent dir (``/tmp/omnigent-tests-...``)
rather than pytest's :data:`tmp_path` because macOS's
``AF_UNIX`` socket path limit is ~104 chars and pytest's
per-test temp dirs (under ``/private/var/folders/...``) push the
full socket path past that ceiling. Each test cleans up its
parent dir on teardown.
